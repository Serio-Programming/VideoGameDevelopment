More work was done on the first enemy, the horrible gelatinous cube.
When the player is in contact with the cube, a specific sound plays on loop and an acidic smoke comes off the player, to let them know something is happening.
When the cube comes into contact with a harmless animal, it plays a random squishy sound and the animal explodes into a cloud of smoke.
Random objects like skulls and hats float around in the cubes, to make them interesting. There are also random jelly things floating in them as well.
The horrible cubes are semi-random in their color, spawning as either of a shade of green or a yellow.
The cube sprites, being square with splotches in certain areas, are also randomly rotated at 90 degree increments before the cube is created.
The rotation of the cubes gives them some different looks, so they all aren't always the same.
The cubes expand and contract as they move, to make them more interesting.

The magic object is now used as a parent object for all magical attacks, passing a magic damage value of 0, to be set for each specific spell.
The enemy object was created as a parent object for the horrible gelatinous cube, as well as any future enemies.
The cube has a health variable now, and when it takes too much damage, it disappears in a cloud of acidic smoke.
The wizard staff hits do anywhere between 0 and 2 damage, so that the player doesn't rely on them too much.

THINGS TO DO
>Make sure to also flip horrible gelatinous cube sprites after rotating them, for more patterns.
