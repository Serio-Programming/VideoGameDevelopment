More work was done on the first enemy, the horrible gelatinous cube.
When the player is in contact with the cube, a specific sound plays on loop and an acidic smoke comes off the player, to let them know something is happening.
When the cube comes into contact with a harmless animal, it plays a random squishy sound and the animal explodes into a cloud of smoke.
Random objects like skulls and hats float around in the cubes, to make them interesting. There are also random jelly things floating in them as well.
The horrible cubes are semi-random in their color, spawning as either of a shade of green or a yellow.
The cube sprites, being square with splotches in certain areas, are also randomly rotated at 90 degree increments before the cube is created.
The rotation of the cubes gives them some different looks, so they all aren't always the same.
The cubes expand and contract as they move, to make them more interesting.
A video of the cube can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nQF6z40qQ

- 2024 October 20th -
The magic object is now used as a parent object for all magical attacks, passing a magic damage value of 0, to be set for each specific spell.
The enemy object was created as a parent object for the horrible gelatinous cube, as well as any future enemies.
The cube has a health variable now, and when it takes too much damage, it disappears in a cloud of acidic smoke.
The wizard staff hits do anywhere between 0 and 2 damage, so that the player doesn't rely on them too much.

Have been spending past few days brainstorming things to be added to the game.

- 2024 October 27 - 
Worked on game today and yesterday.
The wizard can now kill a horrible gelatinous cube, complete with splattery sound effects.
A video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJvEMA-lE7s&ab_channel=ForeignIntelligenceAlliance
Discovered that different instances of the cube all play the same sounds, which interferes with how the sounds are supposed to be played.
There is no problem when a single cube exists, but when multiple exists, the only cube that plays any sounds was the one most recently spawned.
Will need to use audio emitters in order to get the desired effect.
The cubes now also drop whatever item they were carrying in them onto the ground. Text of the item floats above it when it lands. The item slowly fades away.
Once the alpha is zero, the item will disappear. The text will disappear as well. 

- 2024 November 6 -
Worked on game last weekend, and some earlier this week. 
Horrible gelatinous cubes now have audio emitters that follow them, playing weird noises.
This allows for the falling off or gaining of volume as the monsters get closer or farther from the player.
Each horrible gelatinous cube now also has their own sounds stored in variables.
This avoids the issue of each instance of a cube trying to play the same sound asset, which interferes with representation to the player.
A video demonstration of the audio emitters in action can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z54H7TuQ3tM
Cubes now have more splatterly death effects, which slowly dissolve away.

- 2024 November 12 -
Worked on game last weekend and Veterans Day.
Continued working on sound emitters. Discovered an issue where sounds come from left and right, and can be silent depending on whether or not the sound is coming from the left or right of the Wizard.
This issue was fixed by orienting the GameMaker listener to "look" or "face" along the x-axis, so that both "ears" are positioned the same distance away from whatever is making a noise.
This allows the player to hear sounds falloff equally from the left and right earphones, depending only on the distance of the sound emitter from the player without regards to which ear is closer.
Left vs right hearing might work better in different kinds of games, but this one will not focus on that.

----- THINGS TO DO -----
- ENEMIES -
*Horrible Gelatinous Cube: 
  Sprite:
    >Make sure to also flip horrible gelatinous cube sprites after rotating them, for more patterns.

  Characteristics:
    >Give the cube a moderate to high level of health. It is a damage sponge and should be able to tank a lot.

  Movement/Animation/Effects:

  Falling:

  Attack/Animation/Effects:
    >When the wizard is inside the cube, slow all movement (walking, falling, jumping) to make it harder to escape the horrible cube.

  Death/Animation/Effects:
    >Done 2024 October 27th. When the cube is killed, have a more dramatic smoke/explosion effect take place. (Added more smoke to cube death. Plan to add more effects.)
    >Done 2024 October 27th. When the cube is killed, play a sound randomly from a list of gelatinous cube death noises. (Will probably add a few more death noises to the list of noises to choose from.)
    >Done 2024 October 27th. When the cube is dying, play a melting animation. (Decided instead on having splattery objects created when the cube dies.)
    >Done 2024 November. Add just a little more splattery-ness when the cube dies. 

  Drops:
    >Make the object floating in the cube disintegrate most of the time, but sometimes get left behind when the cube dies.
    >Allow the player to interact with this object, and search it for items.
  
  Sound:
    >Use audio emitters for when the cube dies as well, or else the player will hear the death sound even if the cube is far away. 
    >Use audio emitters for the sound of the player being eaten by the cube.
    >Done 2024 November. Start using audio emitters so that when the player is next to a cube, it always plays the "gel walking" sound proportional to the distance from the player. 
    >Done 2024 November. Remember to use audio emitters or else only one instance of an object will play the sounds that it is supposed to.
  
  Spawn:
    >Create a horrible gelatinous cube spawning object, that creates horrible cubes depending on the number left and a time factor.
    >When the cubes spawn, have them grow slowly as if oozing onto the scene, and make sure to have a sound effect for this.
    >Create a random rusty sewer pipe that slowly oozes out a tiny cube that grows into the monster.

*Fat Ugly Rat:
  Sprite:
    >Make the rats randomly vary in color from black, to brown, to white.
    >Make some of the rats have random splotches/spots of color on them. 
    >Add a random and rare version of the Fat Ugly Rat called the Fat Adorable Rat, that is less ugly but still evil, because it is funny.
  
  Movement/Animation/Effects:

  Falling:
  
  Attack/Animation/Effects:
    >Create an attack for the rat where it leaps forward, dealing damage and pushing the player backwards.
    >Create an attack for the rat where it bites at the player, dealing higher damage and pushing the player backwards.
    >Create an attack for the rat where it swipes twice at the player with its claws, dealing lesser damage with no pushing.
    >Create a very rare attack where the rat stands up, pulls out a knife, and stabs the player, dealing moderate damage and pushback, because it is funny.
 
  Death/Animation/Effects:
    
  Sound: 
    >Create a sound emitter that follows the rat and plays these sounds.
    >Collect at least 5 sounds to randomly play when the rat attacks the player with scratches.
    >Collect at least 5 sounds to randomly play when the rat attacks the player with a bite.
    >Collect at least 5 sounds to randomly play while the rat wanders around.
    >Collect at least 5 sounds to randomly play when the rats die.
