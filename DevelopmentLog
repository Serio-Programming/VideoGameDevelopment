More work was done on the first enemy, the horrible gelatinous cube.
When the player is in contact with the cube, a specific sound plays on loop and an acidic smoke comes off the player, to let them know something is happening.
When the cube comes into contact with a harmless animal, it plays a random squishy sound and the animal explodes into a cloud of smoke.
Random objects like skulls and hats float around in the cubes, to make them interesting. There are also random jelly things floating in them as well.
The horrible cubes are semi-random in their color, spawning as either of a shade of green or a yellow.
The cube sprites, being square with splotches in certain areas, are also randomly rotated at 90 degree increments before the cube is created.
The rotation of the cubes gives them some different looks, so they all aren't always the same.
The cubes expand and contract as they move, to make them more interesting.
A video of the cube can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_nQF6z40qQ

The magic object is now used as a parent object for all magical attacks, passing a magic damage value of 0, to be set for each specific spell.
The enemy object was created as a parent object for the horrible gelatinous cube, as well as any future enemies.
The cube has a health variable now, and when it takes too much damage, it disappears in a cloud of acidic smoke.
The wizard staff hits do anywhere between 0 and 2 damage, so that the player doesn't rely on them too much.

----- THINGS TO DO -----
Horrible Gelatinous Cube: 
>When the cube is killed, have a more dramatic smoke/explosion effect take place.
>When the cube is killed, play a sound randomly from a list of gelatinous cube death noises.
>When the cube is dying, play a melting animation.
>Make the object floating in the cube disintegrate most of the time, but sometimes get left behind when the cube dies.
>Allow the player to interact with this object, and search it for items.
>Make sure to also flip horrible gelatinous cube sprites after rotating them, for more patterns.
>Create a horrible gelatinous cube spawning object, that creates horrible cubes depending on the number left and a time factor.
>When the cubes spawn, have them grow slowly as if oozing onto the scene, and make sure to have a sound effect for this.

Player:
>Add an inheritable player object that includes heatlh, mana, endurance, defense, and other important characteristics.
>Create a player inventory that keeps track of all the items the player has.
>Create a menu screen for the inventory to be displayed, and to allow the user to organize items.


Dungeons:
>Every environment/dungeon should have a difficulty modifier, that makes enemies stronger or weaker depending on the character level/area/other factors.
>Each dungeon must be procedurally and randomly generated. The length of the dungeon is randomly decided beforehand.
>After the player completes a dungeon, like a cave system, the player returns to the outside of the dungeon. The entrance will now take them to a new randomly generated dungeon.


Magic:
>Create 20 spells.
  - Create "Polymorph into Butterfly" spell that changes the player into a butterfly. After a puff of smoke, the player is a butterfly.
  - Create "Heal Booboo" spell that heals the player for a small amount of damage. After a yellowish/golden flash, the player glows a little and is healed.
  - Create "Become Barrel" spell, that changes the player into a barrel after a puff of smoke.
  - Create "Ice Bolt" spell, this spell shoots a spike of ice that deals magic/ice damage, and slows the enemy.
  - Create "Volatile Vapor" spell, this spell highlights the player in green and surrounds them by a mist of poison, that deals damage over time to enemies.
>Start the player with a "spell crumpled napkin" that contains a single, random, probably useless low-level spell.
>Think about how to add a system that randomly generates spells, and assigns names based on characteristics.
>Think about randomly choosing spell type, damage, size, movement characteristics, and combining damage types.
>Think about how to add fire type magic and damage.
>Think about how to add ice type magic and damage.
>Think about how to add poison type magic and damage.
>Think about how to add polymorph spells (turn player into harmless animals, turn enemies into harmless animals).


Items:
>Create wands that have a random number of charges, and that cast random, predetermined spells.
>The structure of the spell should decide the name of the wand.
>The wands should be rechargeable, by visiting a merchant or through some costly player method.
>Create rings, necklaces, belts, socks, that can equipped by the player.
>Allow for the enchantment of items, so that if they are equipped or carried, they give bonuses to the player.
>Make enchantments very rare and costly.
>Allow for the player to enchant their hats, robes, and staffs.
>Allow for the disenchanting of item, also make it very expensive. More expensive to remove specific effects while leaving others.

NPCs:
>Make a wandering band of dwarf traders on a wagon. They can be interacted with, and items purchased from them. Food for healing, alcohol for mana.

Harmless Animals:
>Create rats that skitter back and forth, and have them spawn in gross places and underground.
>The rats should randomly play squeaking noises as they move around.

Furniture:
>Create chairs that the wizard can sit down in.
>Create an orb object, and place it on a table next to a chair, and allow the player to ponder it and restore their mana.
>Play music while the orb is being pondered.
>Allow the player to stand up after pondering the orb for however long the wish.
>Automatically save the game when the orb is pondered.
>Create wooden barrels that can be searched. If a significant amount of damage is applied, have them shatter.
